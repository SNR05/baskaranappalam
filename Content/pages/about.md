# Our Heritage Story
For over three decades, Ram Traders has been crafting the finest appalams in Madurai, carrying forward the rich culinary traditions of South India.

## From Madurai to Your Table
Established in 1985 in the heart of Madurai, Ram Traders began as a small family business with a simple mission: to share the authentic taste of traditional South Indian appalams with food lovers everywhere.

Our founder, inspired by grandmother's recipes, started Baskaran Appalam to preserve the age-old art of appalam making. Using only the finest urad flour, rice flour, and carefully selected spices, we've maintained the same quality and taste that made us a household name.
